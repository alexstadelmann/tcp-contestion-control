# Visualization Web App for TCP-Contestion-Control

### The congestion control Algorithms of TCP Reno (from the 70s) are presented:
* Slow Start
* Congestion Avoidance
* Fast Retransmit
* Fast Recovery 

To this day, these four algorithms still form the backbone of the internet's congestion control.
